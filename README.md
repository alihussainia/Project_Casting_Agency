# Project Casting Agency

## Introduction

Project Casting Agency is a Capstone Project of Udacity Full Stack NanoDegree. The Casting Agency models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. You are an Executive Producer within the company and are creating a system to simplify and streamline your process.

## Specifications

### Models:

* Movies with attributes title and release date
* Actors with attributes name, age and gender

## Endpoints:

* GET /actors and /movies
* DELETE /actors/ and /movies/
* POST /actors and /movies and
* PATCH /actors/ and /movies/

## Roles:

### Casting Assistant
* Can view actors and movies

### Casting Director
* All permissions a Casting Assistant has and…
* Add or delete an actor from the database
* Modify actors or movies

### Executive Producer
* All permissions a Casting Director has and…
* Add or delete a movie from the database

## Tests:

* One test for success behavior of each endpoint
* One test for error behavior of each endpoint
* At least two tests of RBAC for each role

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.8

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the python docs for [Unix](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python) or [Windows](https://docs.python.org/3.8/using/windows.html).

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the project directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the postgres database.

- [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.

The API was developped with SQLAlchemy ORM layer which provide a hight level of abstraction, so it can be configure to interact with many relational database management systems. Althoug we had used Postgresql for developpement and deployment, and we recommend it for testing the project.

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).

## Database Setup

With Postgres server running, create a new database load the backup in `casting_agency.psql` provided file by running from the project directory:
```bash
createdb -U YOUR_USERNAME DATABASE_NAME
psql -U YOUR_USERNAME -d DATABASE_NAME < casting_agency.sql
```
You need to enter your password after each command(by defaul postgresql create a user postgres with password postgres).

## Running the server

Before running the server you need to personalize some environnement variables in `setup.sh` provided file:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=DIALECT+DRIVER://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE_NAME
```

For example `postgresql://postgres:1211211@127.0.0.1:5432/casting_agency` for database casting_agency within postgres server running locally with default port 5432, user: postgres and password: 1211211

```
EXECUTIVE_PRODUCER_JWT, CASTING_DIRECTOR_JWT, CASTING_ASSISTANT_JWT
```

These variables are essential to successfully run the tests in `test_app.py` provided file, and they need to be updated with fresh JWTs in order to be authorized to interract with the API.

Besides running tests, JWTs are required to be included in requests headers as Bearer Token Authoriezation for all API endpoints.

```http headers
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT
```

### How to update JWTs

To get or update JWTs for a specific role, log into my AUTH0 hosted page with the role corresponding user credentials:

* [here](https://mali1234.auth0.com/authorize?audience=casting_agency&response_type=token&client_id=XisF4SPHpNmpXvLnT7wRZ17V0PCTfsGO&redirect_uri=https://127.0.0.1:8080/login-results/tabs/user-page) if you are running the API locally.

* [here](https://mali1234.auth0.com/authorize?audience=casting_agency&response_type=token&client_id=XisF4SPHpNmpXvLnT7wRZ17V0PCTfsGO&redirect_uri=https://casting-agency-project-101.herokuapp.com/) if you are testing the live API on HEROKU.

#### Executive Producer

xproducer@gmail.com
abacada@123
```

#### Casting Director
```
cdirector@gmail.com
abacada@123
```

#### Casting Assistant
```
cassistant@gmail.com
abacada@123
```

### Running tests and the server

To run the tests, execute from the project directory:
```bash
source setup.sh
python test_app.py
```

Make sure you have internet connection, it is indispensable for validating JWTs with `AUTH0` public keys.

To run the server, from within the project directory directory, first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment, execute:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Demo Page

The API is hosted on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and publically accessible with the following [link](https://mali1234.auth0.com/authorize?audience=casting_agency&response_type=token&client_id=XisF4SPHpNmpXvLnT7wRZ17V0PCTfsGO&redirect_uri=https://casting-agency-project-101.herokuapp.com/).

To test the hosted API or your local one with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/):

* Import the postman collection `./Capstone_project.postman_collection.json`
* Create an environement with the variable:

```bash
base_url=https://casting-agency-project-101.herokuapp.com/
```

or if you would like to test your local API!

```bash
base_url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

* Run the collection whitin the created environement.
